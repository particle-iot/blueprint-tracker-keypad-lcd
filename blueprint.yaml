  This project demonstrates adding a keypad, LCD character display, DAC, and cloud configuration to the Tracker One using the M8 connector. It serves as an example of how the M8 connector can be used to expand Tracker functionality.

  - Using a MAX7360 to read matrix keypads and drive LEDs
  - Connecting a character LCD display with an I2C interface
  - Interfacing with 5V I2C devices
  - Utilizing an I2C DAC (digital-to-analog converter) for LCD contrast control
  - Implementing cloud-configurable settings (contrast)
  - Adding data to location events (keypad digits)
  - Showing GNSS lock and cloud connection status with custom LEDs
